1. Unique Employee List (HashSet, Comparable)

Scenario:
Your company needs a system to store employee records. Employees with duplicate
 employeeId should not be added. Also, they should be stored in sorted order based on employeeId.

Tasks:
	•	Use a HashSet to prevent duplicates.
	•	Implement Comparable<Employee> to sort employees based on employeeId.
	•	Display employees in ascending order of employeeId.

Question:
How will you ensure no duplicate employees are added while keeping the list sorted?
